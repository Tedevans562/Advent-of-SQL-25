Day 24

As the New Year begins, the goals tracker team wants to understand how user types differ. How many completed goals does the average user have in each user_type?


SELECT
    user_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN goal_status = 'Completed' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS avg_completed_goals_per_user_type
FROM user_goals
GROUP BY user_type;


ANSWER


user_type	  avg_completed_goals_per_user_type	
Free	                    2
Pro	                      3
Team	                    4
