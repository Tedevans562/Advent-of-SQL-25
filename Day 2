Day 2
Santa wants to analyze which toys that were produced in his workshop have already been delivered to children. You are given two tables on toy production and toy delivery — can you return the toy ID and toy name of the toys that have been delivered?


SELECT DISTINCT p.toy_id, toy_name
FROM toy_production p
JOIN toy_delivery d ON p.toy_id = d.toy_id
;
