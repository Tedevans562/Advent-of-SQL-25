Day 18
Over the 12 days of her data challenge, Data Dawn tracked her daily quiz scores across different subjects. Can you find each subject's first and last recorded score to see how much she improved?

WITH first_dates AS 

(
    SELECT
        subject,
        MIN(DATE(quiz_date)) AS first_date
    FROM daily_quiz_scores
    GROUP BY subject
)

,


last_dates AS 

(
    SELECT
        subject,
        MAX(DATE(quiz_date)) AS last_date
    FROM daily_quiz_scores
    GROUP BY subject
)

SELECT
    f.subject, d1.score AS first_score, d2.score AS last_score, (d2.score - d1.score) AS improvement_in_score
FROM first_dates f
  
JOIN daily_quiz_scores d1 ON d1.subject = f.subject AND DATE(d1.quiz_date) = f.first_date
  JOIN last_dates l ON l.subject = f.subject
JOIN daily_quiz_scores d2 ON d2.subject = l.subject AND DATE(d2.quiz_date) = l.last_date
;

subject	first_score	last_score	improvement_in_score	
Python	     70	            96	                  26
SQL	         65	            93	                  28
