Day 17
During a quiet evening of reflection, Cindy Lou wants to categorize her tasks based on how peaceful they are. Can you write a query that adds a new column classifying each task as 'Calm' if its noise_level is below 50, and 'Chaotic' otherwise?

SELECT *, CASE WHEN noise_level < '50' THEN "Calm" ELSE 'Chaotic' END AS task_peacefulness
FROM evening_tasks
