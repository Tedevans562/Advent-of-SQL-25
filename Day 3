Day 3
The Grinch has brainstormed a ton of pranks for Whoville, but he only wants to keep the top prank per target, with the highest evilness score. Return the most evil prank for each target. If two pranks have the same evilness, the more recently brainstormed wins.



SELECT target_name, prank_description
FROM (
    SELECT
        target_name,
        prank_description,
        evilness_score,
        created_at,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY target_name
            ORDER BY evilness_score DESC, created_at DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM grinch_prank_ideas
)
WHERE rn = 1;
